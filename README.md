## General Information
- This software allows you to do various operations on IPv4
- You can make CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) with FLSM (Fixed Length Subneting Mask)
- You can make CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) with VLSM (Variable Length Subneting Mask)
 

## Language Used
- Python 3



## Features
- Variable length subnetting mask.
- Calculate hosts/subnets/masks automatically.
- Get IPs intersections.
- Check for IPs inclusions.


## Setup
Thie file (ip4LabV02) is the PyQt5 file.
This one (IP_LabV02_Functions (main)) is the main file.

Below packages will be needed:
-sys
-PyQt5.QtWidgets import QDialog, QApplication
-PyQt5 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets
-PyQt5.QtCore import QCoreApplication, QRegExp
-PyQt5.QtGui import QRegExpValidator
-math
-ipaddress
-re
-clipboard
-tkinter
-time


## Usage
Just type in your IP and make your own calculations.



## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ I put it here so anyone has a creative idea to add it on. However, my main vision to create tools that reliably help all Network Engineers.


## Room for Improvement
- Export Scripts based on simple input.
- Check remote terminals.
- Check Network units.
- ...etc
